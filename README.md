# Save and Load Tutorial Files
These files are from my [tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG214byjuTWOWsZXGP9IyZhxipNb5MvnM&si=XtPW5qYeGAsOwMCg) on saving and loading in Godot (4.5 and similar). 

The [***save_load*** directory](save_load) has the ***IH_SaveLoad*** plugin. If you want to use it in your game, be sure to enable it.

> Project (dropdown) -> Project Settings (option) -> Plugins (tab) and enable ***IH_SaveLoad***.

The directories [***basic_save_load***](basic_save_load) and [***advanced_save_load***](advanced_save_load) both depend on the [***IH_SaveLoad*** plugin](save_load) and have common files, since they are different versions of the same project for the different tutorials in my series.
